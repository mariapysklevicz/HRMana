##Human Resources Management

> The purpose of this software is to manage personal information of active and inactive employees in a company.
> Idealized to use Debian dedicated server, initially with MySQL database, developed in Java.  
>The system was designed to be intranet (client-server) in a separate pool of the local network, available only to system users.  
>Although it is intended to be a client-server system, it can also be used on only one machine, for companies with low data volume.  
>Designed for the needs of Japanese market niche, the software has specific fields for data entry, specific to Japanese characters.  
>For the field of outsourcing, where the need for specific data of his workers is different, especially when it comes to foreign workers data, where the amount of data required is much higher than a native worker.  
>The system has an area where the administrator can add new users, restricting the access and the permissions to update the data, depending on the profile to which it is assigned.  
>In addition, this system was also designed so that the financial impact is the smallest possible, making the most of existing equipment, when they are not too obsolete, considering the performance and tasks that these equipments should do.


## Refactoring

>The software was developed as a generic solution, in which any company could use it. In the refactoring phase, the software can be adapted to the specific needs of any company.
